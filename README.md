# EcoSort — Intelligent Recycling Sorting System

ICT304 Assignment and Project: Developing an AI System. EcoSort classifies a photo of a
waste item into one of six recycling categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic,
trash) and returns a confidence score with the prediction. This repository holds the
**prototype of the AI sub-system**: two trained classifiers, their evaluation on a
held-out test set, and the figures that support the assignment report.

## What is built and what is not

Built for the Assignment (due 3 October 2026):

- Data pipeline: TrashNet load, EDA, stratified 70/15/15 split, random_state=42
- Technique A: SVM on HOG + colour-histogram + GLCM features, inside a scikit-learn
  `Pipeline` with `GridSearchCV` and `probability=True`
- Technique B: MobileNetV2 transfer learning (TensorFlow/Keras, ImageNet weights,
  augmentation, class weights for the minority class)
- Evaluation: accuracy, per-class precision/recall/F1, confusion matrices, inference
  latency, comparison table
- One-image inference demo returning `(class, confidence)`
- An upload box (Step 7 in the notebook) so a reader can classify their own photo and see
  both predictions with the routing decision, (a saved notebook page cannot show live widgets; press Copy & Edit on Kaggle and run the cell to get the box)

Designed but not built yet (Final Project, due 7 November 2026): image capture,
decision and bin-routing, which routes items whose confidence falls below a
threshold θ into a human-review queue, plus logging and
dashboard, user interface, simulated actuation. A static HTML mockup of the dashboard
exists in the team working folder; it is not connected to live data.

## Results

Run on Kaggle (2× T4 GPU), 2 October 2026. Test set: 380 held-out images.
Latency is averaged over the test set.

| Technique | Accuracy | Macro-F1 | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| SVM (HOG + colour + GLCM) | 0.711 | 0.703 | 2.7 ms/image |
| MobileNetV2 (transfer learning) | 0.832 | 0.817 | 3.7 ms/image |

Per-class F1 (test set, 380 images):

| Class | SVM F1 | MobileNetV2 F1 |
|---|---|---|
| cardboard | 0.76 | 0.90 |
| glass | 0.69 | 0.82 |
| metal | 0.67 | 0.83 |
| paper | 0.80 | 0.86 |
| plastic | 0.64 | 0.79 |
| trash | 0.67 | 0.70 |

Accuracy 0.832 sits just under the REQ-01 target of 0.85. The earlier runs used small
settings (IMG=128, 8 training epochs) so the notebook also finished on a laptop CPU.
Raising the input to 224x224 and training 12 epochs lifted the CNN from 0.776 to 0.832.
We report the numbers as measured; the report's Discussion covers the remaining gap
(more data for the rare classes, a fine-tuning stage, and threshold calibration).
At 128x128, six runs put MobileNetV2 between 0.755 (a laptop) and 0.803 (Kaggle GPUs);
at 224x224 it reached 0.832. The SVM returned 0.711 every time. The CNN moves a little
between runs, which is expected and is discussed in the report.

## Reproduce

**Kaggle (recommended).** Open the notebook, press Save & Run All. The dataset and the
MobileNetV2 weights are attached, so the kernel needs no internet. The compute
takes about 8 minutes on GPU; allow a few more for session startup and packaging.

**Colab.** Upload `EcoSort_AI_Prototype_vscode.ipynb`, then Runtime → Run all. It
downloads TrashNet from Hugging Face (about 3.6 GB) on first run.

**Local.** `pip install tensorflow scikit-learn scikit-image huggingface_hub matplotlib
seaborn pillow`, then run the notebook (or the `.py` export). On a laptop CPU expect
roughly 20–40 minutes.

Environment for the recorded run: Python 3.12, TensorFlow 2.20.0, 2× T4. Seeds are
fixed at 42 throughout.

## Data

TrashNet (Thung & Yang, 2016): 2,527 images in six classes: cardboard 403, glass 501,
metal 410, paper 594, plastic 482, trash 137 (the minority). The notebook reads, in
order: a local `dataset-resized/` folder if present, any attached Kaggle dataset
mounted under `/kaggle/input`, and finally the Hugging Face Hub download.

## Repository

- `EcoSort_AI_Prototype_vscode.ipynb`: the source notebook
- `EcoSort_AI_Prototype_Kaggle_executed.ipynb`: the executed notebook with outputs
- `EcoSort_AI_Prototype_vscode.py`: a plain-script version of the same pipeline
- `outputs/`: figures from the executed run
- `kaggle/kernel-metadata.json`: the kernel configuration used for the Kaggle run
- `weights/`: the MobileNetV2 ImageNet weights, bundled so kernels can run offline

## Team

Equal three-way split (Group Declaration weighting 0.33 each). Nivetha leads AI and data and wrote the classifier notebook. Robert leads
architecture and integration and maintains this repository. Waitun leads evaluation,
dashboard and reporting, and compiles the report. AI tool use is declared in the report per Murdoch's APA generative-AI
guide, with prompts in the appendix.
